# DogBreedCNN

In this project, we will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images that given an image of a dog, will detect its resembling breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

In order to achieve the aforementioned goals of this project we will make use of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network models for the classification of dog breeds. The Keras library is used to tackle this task. The code was developed using Jupyter Notebooks and Python.
